## Software Design Patterns
#### Bojan Radovanovic

### Design Patterns are...

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a **general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem** within a given context in software design. (Wikipedia)

---

### Design Patterns are...

It is a **description or template for how to solve a problem** that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are **formalized best practices** that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. (Wikipedia)

---

### Design Patterns are not...

It is not a **finished design** that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. (Wikipedia)

### History of Design Patterns

Patterns originated as an **architectural concept** by [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander). (Wikipedia)

### History of Design Patterns

In 1987, [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) and [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) conference that year.

### Gang of Four (GoF)

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_(book)) was published in 1994 by the so-called "Gang of Four" (Gamma et al.), which is frequently abbreviated as "GoF". (Wikipedia)

### Benefits of Design Patterns

First, they provide you with a **way to solve issues** related to software development using a **proven solution**. The solution facilitates the development of highly cohesive modules with minimal coupling. They **isolate the variability** that may exist in the system requirements, making the overall system **easier to understand and maintain**.

### Benefits of Design Patterns

Second, design patterns make **communication between designers more efficient**. Software professionals can immediately picture the high-level design in their heads when they refer the name of the pattern used to solve a particular issue when discussing system design.

### Classification

There are three basic kinds of design patterns:
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

### Creational Design Patterns

### Structural Design Patterns

### Behavioral Design Patterns
