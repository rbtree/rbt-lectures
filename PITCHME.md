## Redux
#### Filip Jovakaric

### What is Redux?

- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- Itâ€™s an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS

+++

### 3 core concepts

- There is a single source of truth for your entire application state
- That state is read-only
- All changes to the application state are made by pure functions
