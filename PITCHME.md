### What are Design Patterns?

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a **general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem** within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a **description or template for how to solve a problem** that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. (Wikipedia)

### History

### History

In 1987, [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) and [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) conference that year.

### Gang of Four (GoF)

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_(book)) was published in 1994 by the so-called "Gang of Four" (Gamma et al.), which is frequently abbreviated as "GoF".
